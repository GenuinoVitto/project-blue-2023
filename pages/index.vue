                <p>
                    Project Blue (PB) is a youth-led nonprofit organization that focuses on raising awareness and providing sustainable solutions on ocean pollution and marine conservation. It started as a cleanup idea that turned into an organization after the realization that cleanups arenâ€™t enough and that we have to be more sustainable. We do a mix of physical and online projects that advocate for the oceans. It was founded in the province of Ilocos last December 2020.
